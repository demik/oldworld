Development ressources for vintage computing (Mostly "Old World" 68k and NuBus PPC Macintosh)

This is my sandbox repository. Once project has reached a quality level that feel adequate, they are moved to their own repo.

### Finished
A few projects are useable as is:
- [ADBDB](/EDA/ADBDB): Apple Desktop Bus developer/debug board 
- [Design68](/EDA/Design68): 65% DIY mechanical keyboard using AppleDesign controllers
- [NUBUSPAS16-DB](/EDA/NUBUSPAS16-DB): A daughter board for the MediaVision NuBus PAS 16
- [PAL16R LART](/EDA/PAL16R%20LART): PAL16R small helper PCB for reversing PAL16Rs 
- [SIMM72BL](/EDA/SIMM72BL): A SIMM72 memory module interposer/debug board

Other stuff is WIP
